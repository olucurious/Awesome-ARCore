ARCore is a platform for building augmented reality apps on Android. ARCore uses three key technologies to integrate virtual content with the real world as seen through your phone's camera:

* **Motion tracking** allows the phone to understand and track its position relative to the world.
* **Environmental understanding** allows the phone to detect the size and location of flat horizontal surfaces like the ground or a coffee table.
* **Light estimation** allows the phone to estimate the environment's current lighting conditions.
